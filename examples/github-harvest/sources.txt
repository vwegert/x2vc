These samples were obtained more or less randomly using the following procedure:
 * search github.com for code with filter
   language:xslt AND content:"version=\"1.0\"" AND NOT content:":import " AND NOT content:":include " AND content:"html"
 * examine files using checker - in case of parse errors, reject
